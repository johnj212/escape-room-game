# Handoff: Sector-9 Command Deck Escape Room Game (v0.1)

This handoff document summarizes the initial request, what worked, what didn't work (along with the solutions implemented), and key lessons learned for future development sessions.

---

## 1. Initial Request
* **Core Goal:** Design and build the initial playable version of a multiplayer 3D cyberpunk escape room game ("Sector-9 Command Deck") for 3 players, implementing the first puzzle: **The Decoupled Power Grid**.
* **Key Features:**
  * **Role-based Asymmetric Puzzle:** The Engineer (P1) sees a flashing wire sequence cipher on a holographic projector console. The Technician (P2) must access a switchboard terminal to toggle matching wire grids. The Overseer (P3) coordinates their efforts.
  * **Controls:** Desktop keyboard/mouse controls and mobile-friendly virtual joysticks (via `nipplejs`).
  * **Play Modes:** Authoritative multi-client server mode (Socket.io) or solo swap mode (offline keyboard swapping using keys `1`, `2`, `3`).
  * **Aesthetics:** Sleek, premium cyberpunk visual style with physically-based rendering (PBR), neon emissives, and glassmorphism UI overlays.

---

## 2. What Worked
* **Concurrently Managed Monorepo:** Configured Vite client (port `5173`) and Node/Socket.io backend (port `3001`) with concurrently launching start-scripts.
* **Asymmetric State Machine:** Auth server managing rooms, player assignments, countdown ticks, wire-toggles, and puzzle verification.
* **Procedural 3D Holograms:** Generated wire sequence cards dynamically based on server-side ciphers.
* **Glassmorphism Overlays:** Rich CSS overlays for game HUDs, lobbies, role select, mobile joysticks, and win/lose screens.
* **Physics & Colliders:** Seamless Rapier integration representing players, pedestals, and room boundaries.

## 3. What Didn't Work (And Was Fixed)

### A. Rapier Capsule Shape Resolution
* **Issue:** Setting `colliders="capsule"` on the `RigidBody` component threw runtime errors (`TypeError: Rg[options.shape] is not a function`), causing players to fail loading.
* **Fix:** Manually defined `<CapsuleCollider args={[0.3, 0.3]} />` child components inside the `<RigidBody>` wrappers to bypass package-specific automated shape resolution.

### B. RigidBody State Transitions (`NaN` Velocity & Position Loop)
* **Issue:** When swapping between players in solo mode, body types transition from `kinematicPosition` to `dynamic`. In the first frame of this asynchronous transition, `linvel()` returns `NaN` coordinates. Setting this velocity caused player position arrays in the Zustand store to become `NaN`, permanently locking the camera follow loop into a black screen void.
* **Fix:**
  * Added linear velocity validation in Player.jsx:
    ```javascript
    const velY = linvel && typeof linvel.y === 'number' && !isNaN(linvel.y) ? linvel.y : 0;
    ```
  * Added safety checks before updating the player positions in the store.
  * Added auto-recovery inside GameCanvas.jsx: if `camera.position` contains any `NaN` values, it directly snaps to the target position rather than breaking.

### C. Camera Obstruction (Opaque Front Wall)
* **Issue:** The third-person camera tracks players with an offset of `[0, 5, 8]`. When Player 3 (Overseer) active at `z = 4` or Player 2 walked forward, the camera coordinate exceeded `z = 10`. This placed the camera behind the solid opaque front wall mesh, rendering a black void.
* **Fix:** In Room.jsx, kept the front wall physical collider parameters for boundaries but made its visual `<mesh>` invisible via `visible={false}`. This allows the camera to view the scene from outside without obstruction.

## 4. Lessons Learned for Future Sessions

1. **Camera Collisions in R3F:**
   When designing a closed room with a third-person camera, avoid placing visual meshes on walls facing the camera offset path. Instead, use physics-only boundaries (`<RigidBody>` colliders with `visible={false}` meshes) so the camera can see through them.
2. **Dynamic RigidBody Type Switching:**
   Changing Rapier rigid body `type` properties dynamically is asynchronous. Always guard linear velocity queries and position updates against `NaN`/`undefined` values during transition frames to prevent corruption of the state machine.
3. **Camera Follow Fallbacks:**
   When writing camera lerp systems, always implement a check for `NaN` coordinates. If the camera position is corrupted, snap it to the target tracking point rather than letting `lerp` propagate `NaN` indefinitely.
